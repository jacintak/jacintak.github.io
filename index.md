This site describes the structure of my GitHub and the code it houses.
On this site there is currently code from my PhD on modelling the life cycle of matchstick grasshoppers.  
The end goal of this GitHub site is to use my PhD as a documented example of a mechanistic model for modelling species responses to climate.

# The power of a mechanistic model
Models are widespread in ecology and evolutionary biology and many things which are categorically different can be referred to as a model. This can generate confusion, as exemplified in the species distribution modelling literature. There are many ways to model the distribution of species and the developments of various methods over the years has lead to a full specturm of approaches, including hybrid approaches.

Here, I define a mechanistic model as one which comprises of explicit processes and is grounded in first principles. Mechanistic models have a reputation for being data intensive and logistically challenging to implement to the point of being too specific to the organism in question. These limitations are not to be taken lightly and, like any model, a bad mechanistic model is not informative. I think these disadvantages are overshadowed by the potential applications of a mechanistic model done properly. 

By far, the most common application of a mechanistic model is for species distributions, but these models are a powerful tool to investigate the ecology and evolution of species.

# My PhD
The framework of my PhD was to create a mechanistic model of species' development to use in modelling life cycles, phenology and distribution. I used the egg developmental traits of the matchstick grasshoppers (Orthoptera: Morabidae) in the genera *Warramaba* and *Vandiemenella*. This GitHub houses the code for my data pipeline from the raw physiological data on egg development to the final mechanistic model. The code primarily focuses on my work on *Warramaba* but the codes and the overall framework should be applicable to any ectotherm to which this analytical framework is suitable for.

## PhD repository structure
Currently the data pipeline for my PhD is organised in a multi-repository structure with each stage of the pipeline within its own repository. Each repository roughly corresponds with a publication but there is additional information which are not relevant to the corresponding publication but is relevant to the overall project. Hence each repository is not necessarily assigned a specific publication and DOI. Each repository for my PhD is labelled with "PhD" at the start.
