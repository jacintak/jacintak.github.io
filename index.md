# About this website

> The work you do is great but I don't understand it

This sentence paraphrases the most common sentiment I get about my research from other ecologists. The fundamental concepts and applications of mechanistic models are generally understood enough for people to appreciate them, but something about the word "mechanistic model" puts people off. I think part of this knowledge gap comes from the hefty body of literature on modelling species that is TL;DR.

Models are widespread in ecology and evolutionary biology and many things which are categorically or philosophically different can be referred to as a model. This can generate confusion, as exemplified in the species distribution modelling literature. There are many ways to model the distribution of species and the developments of various methods over the years has led to a full spectrum of approaches, including hybrid approaches. 

I work on mechanistic models. Here, I define a mechanistic model as one which comprises of explicit processes and is grounded in first principles. I make a distinction between correlative and mechanistic, as well as between phenomenological and mechanistic. This site does not aim to be an introduction to mechanistic models nor will I debate the pros and cons of the different methods. I refer you to the published literature where all these questions have been debated to death. 

Mechanistic models have a reputation for being data intensive, logistically challenging to implement to the point of being too specific to the organism in question, and too complicated to understand. These limitations and assumptions are not to be taken lightly. I emphasise that all modelling approaches need to be **appropriate to the organism or question at hand** and there are pros and cons in all approaches.

I like mechanistic models because the underlying philosophy nicely links with how I perceive ecology and approach ecological problems. They nicely intersect my research philosophies and interests in environmental physiology, adaptation and theoretical ecology. To me, using mechanistic models to solve ecological problems make *sense*.

I think another contributor towards the knowledge gap is the lack of accessible, practical documentation on building a mechanistic model. This is where the correlative modelling community shines. There are a lot of papers on the frameworks and underlying theory of mechanistic models, and lots of people work on models. But this information is not disseminated for the general ecologist and is generally unhelpful for people wanting to do it themselves.

## Website aims
The point of this website is to document the mechanistic modelling framework I used in my PhD. By using my PhD as a worked example, I hope to demistify mechanistic models somewhat to bridge that knowledge gap.

This site does not aim to be a tutorial on how to do a mechanistic model. I have been using Git in my PhD for version control and the primary aim of my GitHub site is to document my code for my personal use. Therefore, my code has been annotated with someone with existing knowledge about mechanistic modelling in mind (e.g. my supervisor). I also do not provide all my data on my GitHub. But I hope that one could understand the sort of data inputs and outputs required for this approach.

On this website I describe my data pipeline and how it fits into the mechanistic modelling framework. I also point out some resources people can access if they want to try modelling themselves, either with their own data or data from public databases.

# The power of a mechanistic model
One of the things I like most about mechanistic models is that it's more than just modelling species distributions. Mechanistic models are first and foremost tools. They are essentially a representation of the fundamental processes of an organism and how they relate to the environment. This means that they explictly capture how an organism responds or is adapted to their environment. I used my model to not just investigate the factors underlying the distribution of species, but also their phenology and the evolution of insect life cycles.

## My PhD
The mechanistic model was the end product of my PhD. I used the egg developmental traits of the matchstick grasshoppers (Orthoptera: Morabidae) in the genera *Warramaba* and *Vandiemenella*. The code primarily focuses on my work on *Warramaba* but the codes and the overall framework should be applicable to any ectotherm to which this analytical framework is suitable for.
