# The power of a mechanistic model
Models are widespread in ecology and evolutionary biology and many things which are categorically different can be referred to as a model. This can generate confusion, as exemplified in the species distribution modelling literature. There are many ways to model the distribution of species and the developments of various methods over the years has lead to a full specturm of approaches, including hybrid approaches.

Here, I define a mechanistic model as one which comprises of explicit processes and is grounded in first principles. Mechanistic models have a reputation for being data intensive and logistically challenging to implement to the point of being too specific to the organism in question. These limitations are not to be taken lightly and, like any model, a bad mechanistic model is not informative. I think these disadvantages are overshadowed by the potential applications of a mechanistic model done properly. 

By far, the most common application of a mechanistic model is for species distributions, but these models are a powerful tool to investigate the ecology and evolution of species.
