I want to know where animals live and how they persist in their environment. My interests lie at the intersection between ecology, evolutionary biology and experimental biology. 

My research centers on characterising diversity in traits and understanding the consequences of this diversity for abundances and distributions of species. I answer these questions through an integrative combination of field and natural history observations, manipulative laboratory experiments, and quantitative analysis and modelling, grounded within conceptual frameworks.
