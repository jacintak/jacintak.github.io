I want to know where animals live and how they persist in their environment. Traits are a focus of my work because traits are how organisms interact with their environment.

My research follows a general theme of understanding the mechanistic determinants of ecological and evolutionary patterns and the physiological niches of organisms, specifically of ectotherms. My interests lie at the intersection between ecology, evolutionary biology and climate adaptation.

I answer these questions through an integrative combination of field observations, manipulative laboratory experiments and computer modelling in R, grounded within a theoretical framework, such as mechanistic niche models.
