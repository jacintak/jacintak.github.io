Move. Adapt. Die. Ectotherms have adapted their entire life cycle to the rhythm of the seasons. The egg stage is a critical part of insect life cycles that must resist or tolerate environmental fluctuations. How immobile eggs do so and how these mechanisms change in their function or importance over geographical gradients is a complex story.

My past and ongoing research focuses on disentangling the effects of microclimatic variation and inter- and intra-specific variation in physiological traits on life history phenotypes and phenology. 
The relative effects of environmental and individual variation on phenology.
