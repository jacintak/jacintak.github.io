<p>NERD club is a student-led peer-learning and discussion group for staff and postgraduate students in the Departments of Zoology and Botany at Trinity College Dublin. The group meets weekly for topical discussions about science or academia. There are also sub-groups that are dedicated towards specific topics such as R coding and spatial analysis. These sub-groups are focused towards peer-learning where, postgraduates in particular, are encouraged to share their learning experience and expertise in relevant topics.</p>
<p>I have been an active contributor to NERD club and its sub-groups. This page documents some of the outputs I have produced for peer-learning activities.</p>
