# Introduction 

These are course notes about statistical modelling in `R` for Statistics and Computation.

***

## Try it yourself

You can try out the examples and code yourself. I recommend creating an `R` script or Rmarkdown document for your own notes. Datasets used here are from the package `MASS` which comes with `R`. To use any data in `MASS`, `library(MASS)` needs to be loaded first.

## Revision questions

There are some questions for you to answer throughout the chapters. The answers are at the end of the book in Chapter \@ref(answers). Some questions don't have answers but you should think about them. 

## Downloading notes

These notes can be downloaded as a single HTML file without the LaTeX math equations (File -> Save as) or as a PDF.
