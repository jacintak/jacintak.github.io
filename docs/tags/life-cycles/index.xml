      <description>&lt;p&gt;Insect life cycles are adapted to a seasonal climate by expressing alternative voltinism phenotypesâ€”the number of generations in a year. The problem is to understand how this phenotypic variation along latitudinal gradients is generated through the interactions between environmental factors, like temperature, and the traits of organisms, like development rate and dormancy. However, our current understanding is limited by how thermal responses are characterised, competing theories of thermal adaptation and an incomplete understanding of complex life cycles. Using the widely distributed grasshopper genus &lt;em&gt;Warramaba&lt;/em&gt; as a model, we aimed to reconcile theories of thermal adaptation and tested their respective predictions. We hypothesised that the egg stage was a critical life stage for generating latitudinal patterns of voltinism in &lt;em&gt;Warramaba&lt;/em&gt;. We described patterns of voltinism and thermal response of egg development rate within and among species of &lt;em&gt;Warramaba&lt;/em&gt; along a latitudinal temperature gradient. We found a latitudinal pattern of univoltinism at high latitudes and multivoltinism at low latitudes that corresponded with remarkably strong divergence in egg dormancy patterns and thermal responses of egg development. We argue that the switch in voltinism along the latitudinal gradient was generated by the combined predictions of the evolution of voltinism and of thermal adaptation. We conclude that analyses of latitudinal patterns in thermal responses and corresponding life histories need to consider the evolution of thermal response curves within the context of seasonal temperature cycles rather than based solely on optimality and trade-offs in performance.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Predicting ectotherm life cycles</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Move. Adapt. Die. Ectotherms have adapted their entire life cycle to the rhythm of the seasons. The egg stage is a critical part of insect life cycles that must resist or tolerate environmental fluctuations. How immobile eggs do so and how these mechanisms change in their function or importance over geographical gradients is a complex story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My past and ongoing research focuses on disentangling the effects of microclimatic variation and inter- and intra-specific variation in physiological traits on life history phenotypes and phenology.
The relative effects of environmental and individual variation on phenology.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Summer egg diapause in a matchstick grasshopper synchronises the life cycle and buffers thermal extremes</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phenological response is among the most important traits affecting a species&amp;rsquo; sensitivity to climate. In insects, strongly seasonal environments often select for a univoltine life-cycle such that one seasonal extreme is avoided as an inactive stage. Through understanding the underlying mechanisms for univoltinism, and the consequences of its failure, we can better predict insect responses to climate change. Here we combine empirical data and simulation studies to investigate the consequences of an unusual diapause mechanism in a parthenogenetic matchstick grasshopper, &lt;em&gt;Warramaba virgo&lt;/em&gt;, from arid southern Australia. Our field body temperature measurements indicate that this species is a thermoconformer and our laboratory studies of the thermal response of feeding rate imply strong constraints on winter activity. However, the species exhibits no obligate winter diapause, and eggs can develop in one month under constant temperatures approximating the mean soil temperature at the time of oviposition (summer). We show that diurnal temperature cycles exceeding a peak of 36 degrees C inhibit egg development in summer, and that this is sufficient to prevent autumnal hatching of eggs. Development is also strongly retarded below 24 degrees C. Microclimate-driven simulation studies of egg development show that these thermal responses provide robust maintenance of a univoltine life cycle, thereby resulting in survival of heat stress as an egg (due to limited developmental state) and avoidance of cold stress as a nymph and adult (due to overwintering in the soil as an egg).

      <title>Mechanistic models for predicting insect responses to climate change</title>
      <link>https://jacintak.github.io/publication/2016-COIS/</link>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mechanistic models of the impacts of climate change on insects can be seen as very specific hypotheses about the connections between microclimate, ecophysiology and vital rates. These models must adequately capture stage-specific responses, carry-over effects between successive stages, and the evolutionary potential of the functional traits involved in complex insect life-cycles. Here we highlight key considerations for current approaches to mechanistic modelling of insect responses to climate change. We illustrate these considerations within a general mechanistic framework incorporating the thermodynamic linkages between microclimate and heat, water and nutrient exchange throughout the life-cycle under different climate scenarios. We emphasise how such a holistic perspective will provide increasingly robust insights into how insects adapt and respond to changing climates.&lt;/p&gt;
