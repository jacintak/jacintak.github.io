      <description>&lt;p&gt;Thermal tolerances, such as critical temperatures, are important indices for understanding an organism’s vulnerability to changing environmental temperature. Differences in thermal tolerance over ontogeny may generate a ‘thermal bottleneck’ that sets the climate vulnerability for organisms with complex life cycles. However, a species’ microhabitat preference and methodological differences among studies can generate confounding variation in thermal tolerance that may mask trends in large-scale comparative studies and may hinder our ability to assess climate change vulnerability within and among species. Here, we evaluated two approaches to resolving ontogenetic and environmental drivers of thermal tolerance and methodological variation: mathematical standardisation of thermal tolerance and classifying microhabitat preferences. Using phylogenetically informed, multi-level models with a global dataset of upper critical temperatures from 438 Anuran species, we found ontogenetic trends in thermal tolerance were similar across microhabitat preferences and standardising critical temperatures against common methodological variation had little impact on our conclusions. Our results suggested thermal bottlenecks are not strongly present in Anurans but instead, implied strong developmental or genetic conservatism of thermal tolerance within families and ecotypes. We discussed considerations for resolving confounding variation to interpret thermal tolerance at a macrophysiological scale.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Best practices for building and curating databases for comparative analyses</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comparative analyses have a long history of macro-ecological and -evolutionary approaches to understand structure, function, mechanism, and constraint. As the pace of science accelerates, there is ever-increasing access to diverse types of data and open-access databases that are enabling and inspiring new research. Whether conducting a species-level trait-based analysis or a formal meta-analysis of study effect sizes, comparative approaches share a common reliance on reliable, carefully-curated databases. Unlike many scientific endeavors, building a database is a process that many researchers undertake infrequently and in which we are not formally trained. This commentary provides an introduction to building databases for comparative analyses and highlights challenges and solutions that the authors of the commentary have faced in their own experiences. We focus on four major tips: 1) carefully strategizing the literature search; 2) structuring databases for multiple use; 3) establishing version control within (and beyond) your study; and 4) the importance of making databases accessible. We highlight how one’s approach to these tasks often depends on the goal of the study and the nature of the data. Finally, we assert that the curation of single-question databases has several disadvantages: it limits the possibility of using databases for multiple purposes and decreases efficiency owing to independent researchers repeatedly sifting through large volumes of raw information. We argue that curating databases that are broader than one research question can provide a large return on investment, and that research fields could increase efficiency if community curation of databases was established.&lt;/p&gt;
