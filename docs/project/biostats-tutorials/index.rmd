# Introduction

`biostats.tutorials` is an `R` package of `learnr` tutorials for introductory biostatistics and `R` at an undergraduate level.

The package is still in development so stay tuned for updates. 

You can check out a `learnr` package for practicals on statistical modelling and functional responses [here](/project/statistical-modelling/).

You can check out various tutorials about using R for NERD club (postgraduates and staff) at Trinity College Dublin [here](/project/NERD-club/).
