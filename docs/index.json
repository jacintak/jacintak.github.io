It is also easy enough to add your own palettes if you are comfortable with manually editing package functions in R.\nWe are happy to accept community contributions. Adding pre-chosen hex codes is easy to do. It may take longer to make a palette if we need to chose hex colours from an image.\nThe general structure for a set of palettes is:\npalette \u0026lt;- list(\rpal1 = rbind(c(\u0026lt;hex codes\u0026gt;), c(\u0026lt;order of discrete colours\u0026gt;))\r)\rTwo things to note:\n\rThe hex codes are stored as a vector in the first row of the list\rThe second row of the list is a vector of the order colours are used when plotting discrete colours\r\r\r\r2. Defining and using a palette\rThe palettes in this package are set as above. The main function is the palette generator. It acts as a housekeeping function to allow R to interpret the desired palette for plotting. The behaviour of this function depends on whether a discrete or continuous palette is desired and the number of colours requested.\nIf a discrete palette of 3 colours is desired, then the function will chose the subset of 3 colours to be included from the full option of colours in a palette. The chosen order of these colours is hard coded in the list of palette.\n\rNote there is no need to tell colRoz what theme the palette you want is in. Type in the palette name and colRoz will search the entire oz_palette list\n\rpal \u0026lt;- colRoz_pal(name = \u0026quot;ngadju\u0026quot;, n = 3, type = \u0026quot;discrete\u0026quot;)\r# a palette of only 3 colours\rlibrary(ggplot2)\rggplot(iris, aes(Petal.Width, Petal.Length , colour=Species)) +\rgeom_point() +\rscale_colour_manual(values = pal) +\rtheme_classic()\rIf a continuous palette is desired, then the function will use the function colorRampPalette in the grDevices package (included in R) to generate a gradient of colours between the first and last colour in the desired palette.\n\"continuous\" palettes are generated by default if the type argument is left blank. In ggplot2, use the function scale_colour_gradientn to set the continuous scale.\npal \u0026lt;- colRoz_pal(name = \u0026quot;ngadju\u0026quot;, n = 50, type = \u0026quot;continuous\u0026quot;)\rggplot(iris, aes(Petal.Width, Sepal.Length , colour=Petal.Length)) +\rgeom_point() +\rscale_colour_gradientn(colours = pal) +\rtheme_classic()\r***\n\r3. Visualise a palette\rThe function to plot the palette is only for graphing. Information is taken about the number of colours to plot from the desired palette and the palette is plotted. The name of the palette is shown.\nprint_palette(colRoz_pal(\u0026quot;c.decresii\u0026quot;))# if empty, all colours are shown\rprint_palette(colRoz_pal(\u0026quot;c.decresii\u0026quot;, type = \u0026quot;discrete\u0026quot;, n = 4))\rprint_palette(colRoz_pal(\u0026quot;c.decresii\u0026quot;, type = \u0026quot;continuous\u0026quot;, n = 30))\r\rPalettes\rcolRoz has a number of palettes sorted by categories:\n\rBirds\rFish\rFrogs\rInverts\rLandscapes\rLizards\rMammals\rPlants\rSnakes\rWarramaba grasshoppers\r\r\rPalette by categories\rBirds\rnames(oz_palettes$birds)\r[1] \u0026quot;p.cincta\u0026quot; \u0026quot;c.azureus\u0026quot; \u0026quot;m.cyaneus\u0026quot; \u0026quot;d.novae\u0026quot; \rBlack-throated finch.

Make sure the proper rtools is installed. An error message will appear if rtools does not have permission to create zip files.\nTo give permission for creating .zip for windows:\rControl Panel \u0026gt; System and Security \u0026gt; System \u0026gt; Advanced System Settings \u0026gt; Environmental Variables \u0026gt; add “C:/RTools/bin”\nYou may also need to install dependent packages like tth for math notation.\n\rTypes of questions\r\rSingle correct answer MCQ (schoice)\rMultiple correct answer MCQ (mchoice)\rNumeric answer (num)\rString (string)\r\rCloze is another option but is not supported by blackboard, this permits a combination of the above for the MCQ answer list\n\rBuilding an exam question\rThere are several file types that are supported when writing your question but I have stuck with ‘.Rmd’. There are four parts of a question file:\nThe question\rThe answer list\rThe solution list for giving feedback\rThe meta-information\r\rEach of these sections are defined by a header tag marked by =====. # does not work as a tag.\nQuestion\rThe tag for defining the question is:\nQuestion\n========\nThe various random number generators in R will be your friend.\nsample() # pick n random number(s) from a vector of discrete numbers\rrunif() # generate a vector of continuous numbers, can set min and max\rrnorm() # generate a vector of continuous numbers from a normal distribution with a defined mean and standard deviation\rThings to note\r\rCode chunk options are in effect. By default figures will have captions, turn it of with fig.caption = \"\". Other useful figure options are figure sizes. Figure options can also be defined when compiling the exam\rYou can show code with echo = TRUE, turn off R formatting with results = \"asis\" \u0026amp; hide results with results = \"hide\"\rLaTeX formatting is fine in markdown and outside code chunks\rTo allow for randomised questions within a question file I had to escape the R code chunk to render the output as html, else the randomised question would be rendered as R output\rYou can generate a file to go with the question using any R write to file function. Include the file in the question as normal for Rmarkdown - [filename](filelink). Leave this as default or exams will not be able to find the file\r\r\r\rThe answer list\rThe answer subheading is defined by the tag:\nAnswer\n========\nBulleted markdown after this tag will be considered the options for an MCQ answer list.\nThings to note\r\rexams contains several helper functions to make it easy to generate lists of answers.\n\ranswerlist accepts a vector of answers. It also generates the answer subheading so there is no need to type it in.\rRecommend using html in case LaTeX does not render properly, particularly when called as a string in an R code chunk.\n\rDo not randomise the answer list here, use the metadata, else an incorrect answer will be assigned to be the correct one.\ncomment = NA in the code chunk options will remove the # from the R output.\n\rThere are also helper functions for various things. mchoice2string() turns the solutions vector above into binary responses for the meta-information section. num_to_choice generates a MCQ list of numbers for a numeric answer.\r\r\r\rSolution\rYou can provide feedback via the solution header, including which answers are correct\nSolution\n========\nYour solution here or correct answer: code for answer (or answer[])\nAnswerlist\n-———\n* True\n* False\n* etc.\n\rImportant There should be no spaces after the header tag title, i.e. markdown formatting\n\r\rQuestion metainformation\rThis is an important section of the question because it defines the correct answer. Metainformation is defined by the tag:\nMeta-information\n================\nUseful variables are:\n\rexname = title of question, becomes name of the pool in blackboard\rextype = type of question (num/schoice/mchoice)\rexsolution: order of correct answers in binary (e.g. 01010) for MCQ or R code for numeric output - e.g. \rextol = the tolerance range for numeric questions\rexshuffle = Whether to shuffle the answers or not. This can be used to randomly select a subset of answers from an answer list. Provide a number of answers for non-numeric questions (e.g. 4 for 4 answers). TRUE/FALSE is also accepted.\r\r\r\rAn example question\rThis example displays the correct answer and 3 randomly chosen option out of 6 possible answers.\nQuestion\r========\rWhat is your name?\r\\```{r question, results = \u0026quot;hide\u0026quot;, echo=F}\r# list of possible answer as a character vector\rknights_of_camelot \u0026lt;- c(\u0026quot;Arthur, King of the Britons\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Sir Lancelot the Brave\u0026quot;,\r\u0026quot;Sir Robin the Not-Quite-So-Brave-as-Sir-Lancelot\u0026quot;,\r\u0026quot;Sir Galahad the Pure\u0026quot;,\r\u0026quot;Sir Bedevere the Wise\u0026quot;,\r\u0026quot;Patsy\u0026quot;)\r# solution to the vector above solutions \u0026lt;- c(FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE)\r# explanations (feedback for students)\rexplanations \u0026lt;- c(\u0026quot;I didn\u0026#39;t vote for him\u0026quot;,\r\u0026quot;His favourite colour is blue\u0026quot;,\r\u0026quot;He doesn\u0026#39;t know the capital of Assyria\u0026quot;,\r\u0026quot;His favourite colour is blue.

Knows nothing about swallows\rFalse. I didn\u0026#39;t vote for him\rFalse. His favourite colour is blue. No, yel.\rTrue. His favourite colour is blue\rYou could also skip the solutions vector and include it in the explanations vector like c(\"False. I didn't vote for him\"). Of course, the solution does not appear immediately in blackboard but make sure the option for solutions and feedback to appear is checked.\n\rCompiling the exam\rI have written a script to compile the exam.\rThe compiling function (exams2blackboard) requires a list of file names to generate the exam. Each file represents a question. Versions of a question (n) generate a pool of questions. The list should not contain subdirectories or files not to be included in the exam. exams2html is a means of checking a file/list of exam questions renders properly in html (or exams2pdf).\nThere are several means of customising the metadata of the exam. Here I have:\n\rturned off partial marks - is TRUE by default\rused custom directories to search for the questions and save the output zip.\rset 10 copies for each question using the variable n\rset the name of the zip file using the variable name\rset the number of points for each question to 1, default = 10\r\rlibrary(\u0026quot;exams\u0026quot;)\roptions(device.ask.default = FALSE)\r## content and output directory\rmydir \u0026lt;- \u0026quot;C:/Users/kongj/OneDrive - TCDUD.onmicrosoft.com/Teaching/Biostats/Midsem MCQ\u0026quot;\r## define exam questions (each item in list is a pool)\rmyexam \u0026lt;- list.files(paste0(mydir,\u0026quot;/questions\u0026quot;), pattern = \u0026quot;.Rmd\u0026quot;)\r# render single question\r#exams2html(list(\u0026quot;question3.Rmd\u0026quot;), edir = paste0(mydir,\u0026quot;/questions\u0026quot;))\r## generate .zip with Blackboard exam with n replicates\rexams2blackboard(file = myexam, n = 10, name = \u0026#39;Jacinta\u0026#39;, dir = mydir,\redir = paste0(mydir,\u0026quot;/questions\u0026quot;),\reval = list(partial = FALSE, negative = FALSE),\rpoints = 1\r)\r\rThings to note\r\rYou can create a mix of questions in the exam by defining it in the list of questions but it is not recommended for generating pools of questions\rIf the exam is complied with no partial marks, then the blackboard exam will have no partial marks even if the option is checked within blackboard\rYou can generate a pool of questions by compiling a single question and uploading that zip file to Blackboard under “Import Pool”. This is useful for creating random block tests in Blackboard if the compiled zip file is not suitable as an test right away\r\r\r\r","date":1612137600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1610403546,"objectID":"5282367909d2d0b11aedadcd51872d29","permalink":"https://jacintak.github.io/teaching/rexams/","publishdate":"2021-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/teaching/rexams/","section":"teaching","summary":"Reproducible exams","tags":["teaching","R stats","code"],"title":"Quick guide to R/exams","type":"teaching"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"\r\r\rWelcome to Statistics and Computation for Biologists\rInstalling R and RStudio\r\rWindows\rMac\rLinux\rChromebook\r\rWhy R?\rWhy RStudio?\r\rRStudio scripts\r\rFile housekeeping\r\rWorking directories\r\rCreating a script\rLoading data\r\r.txt\r.csv\rCopying data\r\rTry it yourself\r\r\rChecking the data\r\rData structure\rSummarising data\r\rTips\rFinding help\rFinal checklist\r\rRecap quiz\r\rlearnr tutorials\r\r\rWelcome to Statistics and Computation for Biologists\rTraining to become a scientist can be broken down into two parts. First, there is content to learn - these are technical details or “how to” which come from textbooks, lectures or resources on the Internet.\nSecond, is learning how to define problems and how to solve them. This is true for statistics \u0026amp; computation. You can practice this in these drop in sessions and in your other modules. For example, R not working? Work out why, what’s wrong and what to change to make it work.\nIn this module we aim to give you the tools and knowledge to solve your own data science problems. These skills will be important in your later studies or even your career.\nUse the following checklist to make sure you are prepared for this semester:\n\rDo you have R and RStudio installed on your computer?\rIs your R up to date?\rDo you know how to set up scripts and directories in RStudio?\rAre your folders organised in a logical and sensible way?\r\rIf you’ve answered no to any of the above questions, then continue on. Some of you may already have R and RStudio installed from previous modules - that’s great! Check that your version and packages are all up to date (For packages - Under the Packages tab, click Update, For RStudio - Under Help menu at the top, click check for updates).\nRegardless, you should work through this handout to make sure you are comfortable with the basics of R. Use this as a reference throughout semester as we will be revisiting these concepts.\n\rInstalling R and RStudio\rR and RStudio are different software. R is a computer programming language and statistical environment. RStudio is a user interface which has some useful features that makes using R easier. If R is a retro text-based game (the ones where you chose your adventure with just words), then R studio is a graphic based game (like Legend of Zelda). It is possible to use R without RStudio but trust us, RStudio makes everything a lot easier by providing some organisation.\nYou will need to install R AND R studio in that order.\n\rHere’s a video about installing R https://vimeo.com/203516510 and RStudio https://vimeo.com/203516968\n\rYou can follow the instructions below or try the interactive tutorial at https://learnr-examples.shinyapps.io/ex-setup-r/#section-welcome\nHere are the instructions for various operating software:\nWindows\rFor R:\nGo to https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/\rClick “Download R” in the blue box.

Try the instructions on https://blog.sellorm.com/2018/12/20/installing-r-and-rstudio-on-a-chromebook/ or https://github.com/jennybc/operation-chromebook#links-re-r-and-rstudio\rUse RStudio Server\rUse RStudio Cloud https://rstudio.cloud/ (in beta so it may not work)\r\rSorry chromebook users, if your chromebook version is very old then it may not be possible to install R.\n\r\rWhy R?\rR is just one of many programming languages but R is specially designed for doing statistics. Hence it is widely taught in statistic classes. There are other statistics programs (even Excel can do basic statistical tests) but these are normally “point-and-click” programs where you click a button and magic happens. The advantage of R is that it is an open source software where you can see how your data is being manipulated. Which means R is transparent, you can check whether the statistics is done correctly and is easier to see how statistical theory is being applied. It’s no longer magic but science.\n\rWhy RStudio?\rIf you open R itself you’ll see that it’s pretty bare bones. Most annoyingly you have to remember what information is stored in its memory. RStudio is a intermediate program that acts as a mediator between you and R:\nuser -\u0026gt; input -\u0026gt; RStudio -\u0026gt; R -\u0026gt; RStudio -\u0026gt; output -\u0026gt; user\nIf you open RStudio you’ll see several windows that organise how information is passed to R and how output from R is presented:\n\rLeft: The big window is the console. This is the interface with R and is the same as using R on its own. (don’t worry about “terminal”)\rTop right: This window has three tabs: “environment” - shows you what information is stored in R’s memory, “history” - shows your code history \u0026amp; “connections” - don’t worry about this one.\rBottom right: This has several tabs. The most important being “files” - showing you where RStudio is looking at on your computer \u0026amp; “plot” - shows you any plots you make in R.\r\rYou can customise the layout and colour scheme of RStudio in Options.\nThere are other user interfaces for R but RStudio has a lot of support.\nRStudio scripts\rThe greatest advantage of RStudio is that it allows you to write scripts. These are files ending in .R that are created and opened by RStudio. R itself cannot open, read or create scripts. Scripts are text documents of code that you can save on your computer and open later. They provide a guide to what you want to enter to R and saves you from having to type out code over and over again. Before RStudio, we had to save our code in notepad or similar then copy and paste it into R (believe me it was a pain). Now we can do the same but in one click. Importantly, scripts allow reproducibility and helps with problem solving.\nLet’s demonstrate the power of RStudio and scripts…but first an introduction to directories.\n\r\rFile housekeeping\rIt’s important for your computer files to be organised so that you can find your files later. Where possible don’t save your files to a “downloads” folder or your “desktop” - these should not be permanent file locations (OK for temporary ones).\nIn computer science, most operating software are organised in to drives, directories, folders \u0026amp; files. Using Windows as example:\rC:/ is a drive. Within the drive there are folders (e.g. Documents). Folders are groups of files (e.g. my_document.doc). Directories are the cataloguing system describing where files and folders are stored. Directories take the form of an address like “C:/documents/folder/file” which tells a program to look in this location.\n\rWe recommend that in your Documents folder you should have a folder for this module which contains folders for each of the practicals (5 folders). The practical folders should contain the relevant files for the practical. For example:\nDocuments (folder) -\u0026gt; Biostats (folder) -\u0026gt; Practical 1 (folder) -\u0026gt; Script (file)\n\rThe concept of folders and files comes from the days before computers where information was written on paper and stored in filing cabinets.\nDirectories are really important concepts in computer science. We use directories without realising it every time we use a computer.\nWorking directories\rRStudio works off directories. There is a default directory which shows up on the “Files” tab. This is called the Working Directory. You can change this by default under Tools -\u0026gt; Global Options but you can also change this temporarily under Session -\u0026gt; Set working directory.\nThis is the same as entering setwd(\u0026lt;insert directory address here\u0026gt;). It is good practice to keep similar files in the same folder. Otherwise you will need to specify the full address when you call a file that exists in another folder and it can get confusing if your files are all over the place (see below).\nYou can check what working directory R is using by typing getwd(). Note that if you run this from the console you might get a different answer because the default working directory of RStudio might be different to the working directory of a script. The working directory of a script is the folder the script is saved in.\nWhen we type directory addresses in R we can shorten the address used relative to the working directory. Otherwise we would have to type in the WHOLE address starting from the disk drive (usually C:/).\nFor example:\nIf my working directory was “C:/My Documents” and I had a file in my documents folder called “file.csv” that I wanted to load into R, then I do not need to type out “C:/My Documents/file.csv” but could use the short version “file.csv” because R automatically fills in the beginning of the address as it checks its working directory. Note directories are not case sensitive.\nC:\r-\u0026gt; my documents (within drive C - the working directory)\r-\u0026gt; file we want (within my documents)\rIf my working directory was “G:/Folder” and my file was in “C:/my documents”, then the short version “file.csv” would not work because R is using the address “G:/folder/file.csv”. And this address does not exist. It’s like writing the working directory first then adding on the short address after.\nC:\r-\u0026gt; my documents (within drive C)\r-\u0026gt; file we want (within my documents)\rG:\r-\u0026gt; folder (within drive G - the working directory)\r\rThink of directories and addresses like postal addresses - if your address is incorrect the postman (R) wouldn’t know where to go to pick up your parcel (file)\n\rSince addresses are relative, we can also get files stored in sub folders (folders within folders) separated by /. Note that R can understand / but does not understand \\ for computer reasons we do not need to get into. If you really need to use \\ in an address you need to type it twice - e.g. C:\\\\folder\\\\file. Note that if you copied the address of a directory directly from the address bar in Windows Explorer then it will use \\ so you need to replace them with /.\nC:\r-\u0026gt; my documents (within drive C - the working directory)\r-\u0026gt; folder (within my documents)\r-\u0026gt; file (within folder)\rFollowing the above example:\nIf my working directory was “C:/My Documents” and I had a file in a folder within my documents folder, then the full address is “C:/My Documents/folder/file.csv” and short address I could use in R is “folder/file.csv” because R is already looking in “C:/My Documents”. This works for any number of sub-folders within the same working directory.\nC:\r-\u0026gt; my documents (within drive C - the working directory)\r-\u0026gt; folder 1(within my documents)\r-\u0026gt; folder 2 (within folder 1)\r-\u0026gt; file (within folder 2)\rE.g. “folder1/folder2/folder3/file.csv” where folder 3 is within folder 2 which is within folder 1 which is within the working directory. But you wouldn’t have that many subfolders right?\nNow for a more complicated example.\rImagine we had a folder (parent folder) with two sub-folders A \u0026amp; B and we have set our working directory to folder A like this- setwd(\"C:/parent folder/folder A\"). BUT we wanted to access a file stored in folder B (called file.csv). Like so:\nC:\r-\u0026gt; parent folder (within drive C)\r-\u0026gt; folder A (within parent - the working directory)\r-\u0026gt; other files (within folder A)\r-\u0026gt; folder B (also within parent)\r-\u0026gt; file we want (within folder B)\rThe short address “folder B/file.csv” would NOT work because the address R is using is “C:/parent folder/folder A/folder B/file.csv” which does not exist - folder B is not within folder A.\nInstead we have two options:\nTo use the full address “C:/parent folder/folder B/file.csv”\rTo use the relative address and tell R to move up one directory before it starts looking for a file called “file.csv”. In computing, this is denoted ... So the short address becomes “../folder B/file.csv”. Use .. each time you want to go up a directory level.e.g. “../../../file” goes up three directory levels before looking for the file.\r\rThat’s about as complicated as it gets for working directories and if you can’t import data into R - check what the working directory in R is and what the address of the file is.\n\r\rCreating a script\rScripts are files of code that can be directly run in RStudio (.R files). You can create a new script under File -\u0026gt; New file -\u0026gt; Script (Ctrl+Shift+N) or click the white square with a green and white plus sign in the top left corner.\nSave it to your working directory and give it an informative name (e.g. “Dropin1”)\nLet’s add some code to this script by learning how to import data into R.\n\rRun code from your script rather than directly from the console, that way you have a record of what you’ve done and it makes it easy to spot any mistakes you might have made. Put your cursor on the line you want to run then press Ctrl+Enter or click Run.\n\r\rLoading data\rTo use data stored in other files, the data must be loaded or read into R. The function used to load data into R depends on the file type. Files names or directories are designated as character strings (\"\").\nThe function used to import data depends on the file type. read.delim() for deliminated data (hence delim) or read.csv() for csv files are two common ways. read.table() also works for tables. See help(\"read.table\") for the general inputs. The two most important inputs to be aware of are:\n\rheader: Use header = FALSE (default) if your data doesn’t have headers, header = TRUE to force R to recognise headers\rsep: Tells R to recognise how individual observations are separated (hence sep). sep = \"\" or sep = \" \" if it’s tab separated data (with white spaces between data - \"\" is a general indicator for any whitespace, \" \" is specifically 1 space) or sep = \",\" for comma separated values. If the data didn’t import properly it could be because the wrong read function or the wrong separator was used - try another one.\r\r.txt\rText files (.txt) tend to be delimited, meaning information is separated by a space of fixed width. e.g. 1 2 3 4 5 6 (separated by 1 space). This is loaded using read.delim(). Try loading the file “small_sleep.txt”:\nsmall_sleep \u0026lt;- read.delim(\u0026quot;small_sleep.txt\u0026quot;)\rsmall_sleep\rSpecies BodyWt TotalSleep\r1 Africanelephant 6654.000 3.3\r2 Africangiantpouchedrat 1.000 8.3\r3 ArcticFox 3.385 12.5\r4 Arcticgroundsquirrel 0.920 16.5\r5 Asianelephant 2547.000 3.9\r6 Baboon 10.550 9.8\r7 Bigbrownbat 0.023 19.7\r8 Braziliantapir 160.000 6.2\r9 Cat 3.300 14.5\r10 Chimpanzee 52.160 9.7\r\r.csv\rIf data is separated by a comma, it’s called a comma separated value file (.csv). e.g. 1,2,3,4,5,6. Note that .txt files can also be comma separated. The function to read csv is read.csv(). Try loading the file “mammal_sleep.csv”:\nmammal_sleep \u0026lt;- read.csv(\u0026quot;mammal_sleep.csv\u0026quot;)\r\rCopying data\rFor quick and dirty data entry, or for copying code from the Internet, you can load data from the clipboard after highlighting data and copying it. But it is always better to save a data file as a .csv file and importing into R so you always have a copy of the raw data you used.\nFor PC:\nmyclip_data \u0026lt;- read.csv(\u0026quot;clipboard\u0026quot;) # also works with read.delim\rFor Mac:\nmyclip_data \u0026lt;- read.csv(pipe(\u0026quot;pbpaste\u0026quot;)) # also works with read.delim\rWeb browsers might display whitespace differently so try a different separator depending on what web browser you are using.\nTry it yourself\rFor whichever operating system you have, highlight and copy this data and load this data into R using you new R script. Make sure you are using the correct read function:\n Species BodyWt\r1 Africanelephant 6654.000\r2 Africangiantpouchedrat 1.000\r3 ArcticFox 3.385\r4 Arcticgroundsquirrel 0.920\r5 Asianelephant 2547.000\r6 Baboon 10.550\r7 Bigbrownbat 0.023\r8 Braziliantapir 160.000\r9 Cat 3.300\r10 Chimpanzee 52.160\rSpecies,BodyWt,BrainWt,NonDreaming,Dreaming,TotalSleep,LifeSpan,Gestation,Predation,Exposure,Danger\rAfricanelephant,6654,5712,NA,NA,3.3,38.6,645,3,5,3\rAfricangiantpouchedrat,1,6.6,6.3,2,8.3,4.5,42,3,1,3\rArcticFox,3.385,44.5,NA,NA,12.5,14,60,1,1,1\rArcticgroundsquirrel,0.92,5.7,NA,NA,16.5,NA,25,5,2,3\rAsianelephant,2547,4603,2.1,1.8,3.9,69,624,3,5,4\rBaboon,10.55,179.5,9.1,0.7,9.8,27,180,4,4,4\rBigbrownbat,0.023,0.3,15.8,3.9,19.7,19,35,1,1,1\rBraziliantapir,160,169,5.2,1,6.2,30.4,392,4,5,4\rCat,3.3,25.6,10.9,3.6,14.5,28,63,1,2,1\n\r\r\rChecking the data\r\rAlways check that your data loaded properly.

There is grammar, syntax and terminology to learn.\rThe secret to being a coding whiz is practice, practice, practice. Try using R at every opportunity. If you don’t use it, you lose it.\rIt’s OK to google everything. No matter how many years you’ve been using R you will forget something basic.\rA lot of programming is logic. If you can’t describe what you want to achieve in words, then you can’t code it. Sometimes the solution means changing your way of thinking about a problem.\rA lot of errors come from spelling or syntax mistakes. It doesn’t mean you don’t know it, check your code carefully for typos. Missing brackets or quotation marks are common mistakes.\rOften, copying and pasting your error message into google comes up with the solution\rTrial and error is a big part of programming. If it doesn’t work the first time, tweak it and try it again. Getting a function to work might be as simple as adding or removing one of the defined parameters.\r\r\rFinding help\rAll R code comes with help files. You can access them from the “Help” tab in RStudio. If you want help on a specific function, then you can type in help(\u0026lt;insert function name here\u0026gt;). If you don’t know your exact query, you can search using ??\u0026lt;insert term here\u0026gt; - e.g. ??mean.\nThe Internet is really really great for R help. Websites like StackExchange are help forums for programming. Most likely your question has already been answered on StackExchange. The trick is knowing what to type into Google.\nLearning to problem solve independently is not something you learn by reading or something you can be taught. It is a skill you have to learn by doing, which means having a go yourself before seeking help from others. Make asking for help your last option. You’ll see on StackExchange people describe what they want to achieve, what they have done so far, identified what the problem is and provide some reproducible code to help someone else understand their problem. It’s really hard to fix someone’s coding problem without context.\n\rFinal checklist\r\rHave you installed R?\rHave you installed RStudio?\rAre all your versions and packages up to date?\rDo you know how to create and save an R script?\rDo you know how to set your working directory?\rCan you import data into R?\rCan you run a line of code?\rCan you use a function?\r\rRecap quiz\rWhat is the working directory in computing?\nWorking directories are the location (folder) on your computer that the program is looking in by default.

Fostering stronger links between our understanding of terrestrial ectotherm thermal biology and the aquatic realm is important to identify general patterns.\n\rResources for forcasting\rA good model needs good input data!\nA pretty important component of modelling species responses to environmental variables are the environmental variables themselves. In fact, it’s already half the data. Ideally, you would have climatic data at the scale of the target organism, which I will generally refer to as microclimate, but this is often a challenge to acquire. But if you have access to climate data, e.g. gridded weather stations which I will refer to as macroclimate, then there are some solutions for generating microclimate data.\nMost experimental biologists will have access to plenty of data on organism traits but may not have the right environmental data for a model. The good news is with the increasing ease of generating and storing big data, data is now more accessible than ever before!\nMacroclimate\rIf you don’t have access to gridded weather station data for your area of interest, there are some publicly available datasets online for various environmental variables at various scales and resolutions:\n\rWorldClim\rCliMond with CLIMEX and Bioclim datasets\rClimatic Research Unit\r\r\rMicroclimate\rThere are currently a few publicly available datasets of pre-calculated microclimate grids. All these examples were made using NicheMapR:\n\rmicrolim for global scale\rMicroclimOz for Australia only (the lucky country)\rMicroclimUS for USA\r\r\rMicroclimate simulation packages for R\rThere are a few packages for R to simulate microclimates from gridded macroclimate data:\n\rNicheMapR\rMicroclima\rTrenchR\r\rThe one I used in my work is NicheMapR. The default function to generate microclimate in NicheMapR uses the Climatic Research Unit dataset to generate default microclimate output. I used input data at a higher spatial and temporal resolution than the default setting, in addition to querying gridded soil type data. Although the input data to run my scripts is not available, NicheMapR was used to generate the microclim and MicroclimOz datasets which are publicly available under certain soil type parameters.\nThings to consider\rCheck if the environmental datasets are at the resolution and scale appropriate for your intended purposes. If you want to simulate microclimate, you need to make sure you have all the environmental variables needed for the microclimate package: temperature, precipitation, soil type, topography, wind speed, solar radiation etc. You may have to collate input data from multiple sources.\n\r\rTraits\rThere are even a few databases for organism trait data:\n\rThe Insect Developmental Database (IDD) contains temperature-rate data for mostly insect species of agricultural interest\rFor physiological limits GlobTherm is a great initiative but covers CtMax and CtMin only.\rA few recent metaanalyses have combed through the thermal biology literature so you don’t have to! Then you can extract the information you want. Isn’t open, reproducible science great? Here’s a recent example\rDell et al. 2013 complied a dataset on various biological/ecological traits measured at different tempertures for species from all habitats.\r\r\r\rR packages for modelling\rIn my PhD I wrote a custom function for my code to calculate development rate. But there is also a package for that!\ndevRate is a package with commonly used temperature-rate functions, from statistical functions to biophysical ones. You can get it from CRAN.\nThere is a similar package called rTPC. It’s not on CRAN but is available on GitHub.\nNicheMapR, DEB \u0026amp; biophysical ecology\rFortunately, the NicheMapR package is a pretty complete toolkit to model the biology of an organism based on its environment and available resources. Not only does it have a microclimate model but it also has an implementation of the standard DEB model and a biophysical heat and water budget model for ecotherms and endotherms. All that is missing are the correct input parameters.\nHeat and/or water budget equations are useful for calculating the body temperature of an organism but don’t measure growth or development. You could use the estimates of body temperture for calculating development/growth rates but for most small ectotherms that are isothermic, this seems a bit excessive.\nDEB parameters and Add-My-Pet\rYou can find standard DEB parameters at Add-My-Pet and there is a vignette in NicheMapR which goes through the ectotherm model, the DEB model and how to use the DEB parameters from Add-My-Pet in NicheMapR.\n\r\r\rInternational Symposium and Thematic School on DEB Theory for Metabolic Organisation\rInterested in learning Dynamic Energy Budget modelling? There is an international symposium, tele-course and school/workshop that is an intensive course in DEB and its applications. The symposium is held every two years. The most recent one was April 2019.\nWith the resources available you can pretty much develop a mechanistic model without collecting your own data.\nIf there are other useful datasets or links not listed here, let me know!\n\r","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609506606,"objectID":"22846843e25e77b108339fefcfafa8e4","permalink":"https://jacintak.github.io/project/toolbox/","publishdate":"2021-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/toolbox/","section":"project","summary":"Forecasting the environmental physiology of ectotherms","tags":["ectotherms"],"title":"A toolbox for trait-based forecasting","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"\r\rIntroduction\rbiostats.tutorials is an R package of learnr tutorials for introductory biostatistics and R.\n\rSet up\rWe need to set up our computer to start using tutorials in R.\nFollow this checklist in order to make sure you are set up:\nHave you installed R version 4.0 or above? - if not, install/update R\r\rYou can check your R package version using R.version()$version.string\r\rHave you installed RStudio version 1.0.136 or above? - if not install/update RStudio\r\rYou can check your RStudio version using RStudio.Version()$version\r\rHave you installed the following packages? - if not use install.packages() to do so\r\rlearnr - needed to run the tutorials\rremotes (or devtools) - needed to install the tutorials\rknitr - for displaying content\r\r\rIf everything works then you should see a Tutorials tab in one of your RStudio windows (perhaps next to Environment and History)\n\rInstalling the tutorials\rNow we need to install the tutorial.

This has been my weekend coding hobby. It’s taken so long that the under-workings of Hugo and the Academic theme used here have changed in the meantime.\nSetting up a site is simple enough if you follow the instructions online. The template builds a skeleton of the website and all you need to do is replace the placeholder text with your information. Simple right?\nNot quite. The underlying file structure takes some getting used to and you’ll have to trust the magic as your site gets compiled. But once you pass that hurdle, the system is quite powerful and the results are neat.\nThere are many features to take advantage of. My interest was in having one site for code documentation and blogging as I was not satisfied with having a “regular” website (WordPress) with a blog and my code documentation separately on GitHub Pages.\nMy code documentation was also messing up my GitHub. I’m not a big fan of having documentation (e.g. a static website) lumped together with package files. I also didn’t like having an orphan branch for my documentation (no winners here). I can take advantage of the features of Hugo to move my static sites off their respective repositories and into one central one. It’s better this way as some of the static pages weren’t even relevant to the rest of the repo.\nThere are some features that are missing/not easily implemented compared to WordPress that I will miss. You can’t comment (without third party systems) or “follow” people, you can’t schedule posts and you can’t track views unless you set up Google Analytics or similar. The workflow is a bit tedious for fixing minor things (like spelling mistakes).\nI will keep blog posts on the WordPress site as an archive. I have linked to relevant blog posts in this site.\nThere are some peculiarities that require things to be done a certain way:\nThings I noted\r\rI changed the name of the “Public” folder to “docs” so that my site can be built from the “docs” folder on GitHub. This seems the simplest way to organise this. The alternative is to have the “Public” folder on a different branch.\rSometimes it’s a challenge to troubleshoot why things aren’t working they way you want. E.g. I couldn’t work out why the country wouldn’t show up in the document when including an address in YAML\rA header image/thumbnail can be included in the same folder as the content but it must be called “featured” or it won’t be recognised. File names are case-sensitive\rYou can have as many folders as you want called whatever but the (r)markdown file of the page must be called “index”\r\rIn the “Courses” feature the parent page must be called \"_index\" or it won’t work. 🤷\r\rRmd and the “Courses” feature don’t play nicely. Defining a table of contents via bookdown outputs in the YAML doesn’t work and calling toc: true directly in the YAML (following the guide) doesn’t work either.\rbookdown and blogdown don’t play nicely together in the same project either. blogdown will try to render the bookdown pages as a site rather than letting bookdown do its thing and make a nice gitbook.\r\rTo allow this behaviour, you need to make use of the static file builder (See below)\r\rDespite the template saying “Upcoming talks” Hugo doesn’t render things in the future (incl blog posts). You need publishDate in the YAML\remojis are a nice feature 😄\r\r\rUsing the static folder to render a gitbook\rTo render rmd files into another output than blogdown::html_page you can put the rmd in the “static” folder then write a script that compiles the site in a specific order. To permit a gitbook page within the site:\nSave the bookdown files in the “static” folder\r\rIt doesn’t work with files in the “content” folder, these will get the usual treatment\r\rCreate a folder called “R” in the root directory\rCreate an R script called “build.R” in the “R” folder\rAdd the render functions you need.\r\rblogdown::build_dir(\"static\") is a wrapper for plain rmarkdown::render() as is so it works best with simple files\rbuild_dir doesn’t work for our gitbook example because we want a gitbook that knits with bookdown::render_book, otherwise you will get a bunch of HTML files from the standard render function\rThere’s something funny going on with the working directories. Running render_book(\"static/index.rmd\") doesn’t work, neither does the full address. Instead I had to change the working directory for the function to find the right files. I’m not sure where the function is looking as the project working directory is the root directory.\r\r\rThe above means that all the rmd files for the gitbook also get copied into the “docs” folder. I don’t think it’s avoidable. It’s also s l o w e r to build the site because the gitbook gets rendered every time (unless you “comment it off” in the build.R script.\nI also have a line to render my CV rmd into a PDF saved into the static folder. That PDF is then copied to the “docs” folder so I have an updated CV without needing to manually create one every time I update the original rmd. I think this is pretty handy.\nHere’s what my build.R file contains:\n# Make CV PDF\rrmarkdown::render(\u0026#39;content/cv/index.Rmd\u0026#39;, output_format = rmarkdown::pdf_document(keep_tex = FALSE), output_dir = \u0026quot;static/files/\u0026quot;, output_file = \u0026quot;Kong_JD_CV.pdf\u0026quot;)\r# make gitbook\r# blogdown::build_dir(\u0026quot;static\u0026quot;) doesn\u0026#39;t work because we want a gitbook that knits with render_book\r# whereas build_dir uses rmakrdown::render() thus giving html files\rold \u0026lt;- getwd()\rsetwd(\u0026quot;static/teaching/GLM/\u0026quot;)\rbookdown::clean_book(clean = TRUE)\rbookdown::render_book(input = \u0026quot;index.Rmd\u0026quot;)\rsetwd(old)\r\rHaving a drafts folder\rHugo will not render draft blog posts by default but blogdown will still render the files for your local site and these files get pushed to GitHub. If you don’t want your repo to contain spoilers, then you need to separate your draft posts from the published posts.\nOne solution to stop blogdown from rendering .rmd files is to keep them in the “static” folder but Hugo will copy these files to the “public” (or “docs” folder in my case). I could not find an option to tell Hugo to ignore some files in the “static” folder. This does not solve our spoiler problem.\nWe can have a “draft” folder under “content” and tell Hugo to ignore it in the config.toml file (ignorefile) but that doesn’t stop blogdown from rendering the file.\nI haven’t found a solution to stop blogdown from rendering and Hugo from copying the file but Hugo doesn’t add every folder from the root directory to “Public”, only folders that match the template. So I have a folder called “drafts” which contains my drafts. blogdown will still render the files every time they are saved while using serve_site but they won’t interfere with the site itself. When I’m ready to publish them I can copy them to the “content/post” folder. I also added the “drafts” folder to my .gitignore.\nblogdown has a handy function to generate a new blog post. By default it will add the new files to “content/post” but I changed this to write directly to the “drafts” folder via the variable subdir and with a custom date that is used to name the folder:\nblogdown::new_post(ext = \u0026quot;.Rmd\u0026quot;, title = \u0026quot;test\u0026quot;, subdir = \u0026quot;../drafts/\u0026quot;, date = \u0026quot;2021-01-01\u0026quot;)\rblogdown does theoretically have a means of excluding files…\rIn blogdown::build_site there is a function (list_rmds) that lists files in the “content” folder and excludes files beginning with _:\nfiles = files[!grepl(\u0026quot;^_\u0026quot;, basename(files)) | grepl(\u0026quot;^_index[.]\u0026quot;, basename(files))]\rBut you’ll notice it doesn’t exclude files called _index without another ! in front of grepl. For example, if I have an file called _drafts.Rmd, then build_site will ignore it. But if I have a file called _index.Rmd, then build_site will render it. I don’t know what the behaviour of this is supposed to be so I’m not sure if it is a mistake.\nThis function is not present in preview_site which means that the live preview is going to build all your .Rmd files regardless and it will show up on the live preview.\nEither way, your drafts will still get pushed to GitHub unless you specify the files in .gitignore (e.g. **/_*.Rmd) so I wouldn’t say using _ in your file names is an easier option.\n\r\rOther customisations via “layouts/partials” templates\rBecause Hugo copies any folder in the root directory into “docs” which matches the theme template, it will override any files in the “themes” folder that matches the name of the folder in the root directory. This means that you can create custom templates without modifying the original template. Thus, having a folder called “layouts/partials” will override any “partials” templates within the “theme” folder.\nI have added some minor customisations to reflect personal preference:\n\rAdded markdown to the author list in page_metadata_authors.html so that I can customise my name and bold it in the list of authors under publications\rChanged the site footer to include blogdown\rChanged page_metadata.html to show both the last modified and published date. Last modified date is default.\r\r\rI’m not saying goodbye to the grasshoppers so my flavicon is a grasshopper emoji 🦗\n\r\r\r","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609506606,"objectID":"80ce68f768381e67e27ecd2d3c2de49e","permalink":"https://jacintak.github.io/post/2021-01-01-new-year-new-look/","publishdate":"2021-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2021-01-01-new-year-new-look/","section":"post","summary":"Welcome to my revamped website!","tags":["website","github","R stats"],"title":"New Year, New Look!","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Move.

Through understanding the underlying mechanisms for univoltinism, and the consequences of its failure, we can better predict insect responses to climate change. Here we combine empirical data and simulation studies to investigate the consequences of an unusual diapause mechanism in a parthenogenetic matchstick grasshopper, Warramaba virgo, from arid southern Australia. Our field body temperature measurements indicate that this species is a thermoconformer and our laboratory studies of the thermal response of feeding rate imply strong constraints on winter activity. However, the species exhibits no obligate winter diapause, and eggs can develop in one month under constant temperatures approximating the mean soil temperature at the time of oviposition (summer). We show that diurnal temperature cycles exceeding a peak of 36 degrees C inhibit egg development in summer, and that this is sufficient to prevent autumnal hatching of eggs. Development is also strongly retarded below 24 degrees C. Microclimate-driven simulation studies of egg development show that these thermal responses provide robust maintenance of a univoltine life cycle, thereby resulting in survival of heat stress as an egg (due to limited developmental state) and avoidance of cold stress as a nymph and adult (due to overwintering in the soil as an egg).
