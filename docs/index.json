Fostering stronger links between our understanding of terrestrial ectotherm thermal biology and the aquatic realm is important to identify general patterns.\n\rResources for forcasting\rA good model needs good input data!\nA pretty important component of modelling species responses to environmental variables are the environmental variables themselves. In fact, it’s already half the data. Ideally, you would have climatic data at the scale of the target organism, which I will generally refer to as microclimate, but this is often a challenge to acquire. But if you have access to climate data, e.g. gridded weather stations which I will refer to as macroclimate, then there are some solutions for generating microclimate data.\nMost experimental biologists will have access to plenty of data on organism traits but may not have the right environmental data for a model. The good news is with the increasing ease of generating and storing big data, data is now more accessible than ever before!\nMacroclimate\rIf you don’t have access to gridded weather station data for your area of interest, there are some publicly available datasets online for various environmental variables at various scales and resolutions:\n\rWorldClim\rCliMond with CLIMEX and Bioclim datasets\rClimatic Research Unit\r\r\rMicroclimate\rThere are currently a few publicly available datasets of pre-calculated microclimate grids. All these examples were made using NicheMapR:\n\rmicrolim for global scale\rMicroclimOz for Australia only (the lucky country)\rMicroclimUS for USA\r\r\rMicroclimate simulation packages for R\rThere are a few packages for R to simulate microclimates from gridded macroclimate data:\n\rNicheMapR\rMicroclima\rTrenchR\r\rThe one I used in my work is NicheMapR. The default function to generate microclimate in NicheMapR uses the Climatic Research Unit dataset to generate default microclimate output. I used input data at a higher spatial and temporal resolution than the default setting, in addition to querying gridded soil type data. Although the input data to run my scripts is not available, NicheMapR was used to generate the microclim and MicroclimOz datasets which are publicly available under certain soil type parameters.\nThings to consider\rCheck if the environmental datasets are at the resolution and scale appropriate for your intended purposes. If you want to simulate microclimate, you need to make sure you have all the environmental variables needed for the microclimate package: temperature, precipitation, soil type, topography, wind speed, solar radiation etc. You may have to collate input data from multiple sources.\n\r\rTraits\rThere are even a few databases for organism trait data:\n\rThe Insect Developmental Database (IDD) contains temperature-rate data for mostly insect species of agricultural interest\rFor physiological limits GlobTherm is a great initiative but covers CtMax and CtMin only.\rA few recent metaanalyses have combed through the thermal biology literature so you don’t have to! Then you can extract the information you want. Isn’t open, reproducible science great? Here’s a recent example\rDell et al. 2013 complied a dataset on various biological/ecological traits measured at different tempertures for species from all habitats.\r\r\r\rR packages for modelling\rIn my PhD I wrote a custom function for my code to calculate development rate. But there is also a package for that!\ndevRate is a package with commonly used temperature-rate functions, from statistical functions to biophysical ones. You can get it from CRAN.\nThere is a similar package called rTPC. It’s not on CRAN but is available on GitHub.\nNicheMapR, DEB \u0026amp; biophysical ecology\rFortunately, the NicheMapR package is a pretty complete toolkit to model the biology of an organism based on its environment and available resources. Not only does it have a microclimate model but it also has an implementation of the standard DEB model and a biophysical heat and water budget model for ecotherms and endotherms. All that is missing are the correct input parameters.\nHeat and/or water budget equations are useful for calculating the body temperature of an organism but don’t measure growth or development. You could use the estimates of body temperture for calculating development/growth rates but for most small ectotherms that are isothermic, this seems a bit excessive.\nDEB parameters and Add-My-Pet\rYou can find standard DEB parameters at Add-My-Pet and there is a vignette in NicheMapR which goes through the ectotherm model, the DEB model and how to use the DEB parameters from Add-My-Pet in NicheMapR.\n\r\r\rInternational Symposium and Thematic School on DEB Theory for Metabolic Organisation\rInterested in learning Dynamic Energy Budget modelling? There is an international symposium, tele-course and school/workshop that is an intensive course in DEB and its applications. The symposium is held every two years. The most recent one was April 2019.\nWith the resources available you can pretty much develop a mechanistic model without collecting your own data.\nIf there are other useful datasets or links not listed here, let me know!\n\r","date":1607817600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1607901309,"objectID":"22846843e25e77b108339fefcfafa8e4","permalink":"https://jacintak.github.io/project/toolbox/","publishdate":"2020-12-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/toolbox/","section":"project","summary":"Forecasting the environmental physiology of ectotherms","tags":["ectotherms"],"title":"A toolbox for trait-based forecasting","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1607817600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1607901309,"objectID":"dfb8f638a0bdaed12499a0bc4203fb89","permalink":"https://jacintak.github.io/project/biostats/","publishdate":"2020-12-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/biostats/","section":"project","summary":"learnr tutorials for teaching undergraduate biostatistics","tags":["teaching","R stats"],"title":"Biostatistics tutorials","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Move.

To reconcile these models and test their respective predictions, we characterized patterns of voltinism and thermal response of egg development rate along a latitudinal temperature gradient using the matchstick grasshopper genus Warramaba.

Our results show that the switch in voltinism along the latitudinal gradient was explained by the combined predictions of the evolution of voltinism and of thermal adaptation.

In insects, strongly seasonal environments often select for a univoltine life-cycle such that one seasonal extreme is avoided as an inactive stage. Through understanding the underlying mechanisms for univoltinism, and the consequences of its failure, we can better predict insect responses to climate change. Here we combine empirical data and simulation studies to investigate the consequences of an unusual diapause mechanism in a parthenogenetic matchstick grasshopper, Warramaba virgo, from arid southern Australia. Our field body temperature measurements indicate that this species is a thermoconformer and our laboratory studies of the thermal response of feeding rate imply strong constraints on winter activity. However, the species exhibits no obligate winter diapause, and eggs can develop in one month under constant temperatures approximating the mean soil temperature at the time of oviposition (summer). We show that diurnal temperature cycles exceeding a peak of 36 degrees C inhibit egg development in summer, and that this is sufficient to prevent autumnal hatching of eggs. Development is also strongly retarded below 24 degrees C. Microclimate-driven simulation studies of egg development show that these thermal responses provide robust maintenance of a univoltine life cycle, thereby resulting in survival of heat stress as an egg (due to limited developmental state) and avoidance of cold stress as a nymph and adult (due to overwintering in the soil as an egg).

It is also easy enough to add your own palettes if you are comfortable with manually editing package functions in R.\nWe are happy to accept community contributions. Adding pre-chosen hex codes is easy to do. It may take longer to make a palette if we need to chose hex colours from an image.\nThe general structure for a set of palettes is:\npalette \u0026lt;- list(\rpal1 = rbind(c(\u0026lt;hex codes\u0026gt;), c(\u0026lt;order of discrete colours\u0026gt;))\r)\rTwo things to note:\n\rThe hex codes are stored as a vector in the first row of the list\rThe second row of the list is a vector of the order colours are used when plotting discrete colours\r\r\r\r2. Defining and using a palette\rThe palettes in this package are set as above. The main function is the palette generator. It acts as a housekeeping function to allow R to interpret the desired palette for plotting. The behaviour of this function depends on whether a discrete or continuous palette is desired and the number of colours requested.\nIf a discrete palette of 3 colours is desired, then the function will chose the subset of 3 colours to be included from the full option of colours in a palette. The chosen order of these colours is hard coded in the list of palette.\n\rNote there is no need to tell colRoz what theme the palette you want is in. Type in the palette name and colRoz will search the entire oz_palette list\n\rpal \u0026lt;- colRoz_pal(name = \u0026quot;ngadju\u0026quot;, n = 3, type = \u0026quot;discrete\u0026quot;)\r# a palette of only 3 colours\rlibrary(ggplot2)\rggplot(iris, aes(Petal.Width, Petal.Length , colour=Species)) +\rgeom_point() +\rscale_colour_manual(values = pal) +\rtheme_classic()\rIf a continuous palette is desired, then the function will use the function colorRampPalette in the grDevices package (included in R) to generate a gradient of colours between the first and last colour in the desired palette.\n\"continuous\" palettes are generated by default if the type argument is left blank. In ggplot2, use the function scale_colour_gradientn to set the continuous scale.\npal \u0026lt;- colRoz_pal(name = \u0026quot;ngadju\u0026quot;, n = 50, type = \u0026quot;continuous\u0026quot;)\rggplot(iris, aes(Petal.Width, Sepal.Length , colour=Petal.Length)) +\rgeom_point() +\rscale_colour_gradientn(colours = pal) +\rtheme_classic()\r***\n\r3. Visualise a palette\rThe function to plot the palette is only for graphing. Information is taken about the number of colours to plot from the desired palette and the palette is plotted.
