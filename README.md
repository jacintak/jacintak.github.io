## About me
In my PhD, I looked at the egg developmental traits of the matchstick grasshoppers (Orthoptera: Morabidae) in the genera *Warramaba* and *Vandiemenella*. The mechanistic model is the end product of my PhD. The model primarily focuses on my work on *Warramaba* but the codes and the overall framework should be applicable to any ectotherm to which this analytical framework is suitable for.

### Note April 2019
**My repositories are not public yet. I intend to make them public and to provide documentation of the files with explanations of the decision making process as the data gets published.** As more of my work gets published, I may add more detailed documentation to supplement the publications.

Please drop me a line if you have questions or suggestions about this site.

See my [regular research site/blog](https://jacintakongresearch.wordpress.com) for information about my research.
