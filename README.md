# About me
I'm a environmental physiologist with an interest in how species are adapted to and respond to their physical environment. I look at these questions using field, experimental and computational modelling approaches within a theroteical framework.

### Note April 2019
**My repositories are not public yet. I intend to make them public and to provide documentation of the files with explanations of the decision making process as the data gets published.** As more of my work gets published, I may add more detailed documentation to supplement the publications.

Please drop me a line if you have questions or suggestions about this site.

See my [regular research site/blog](https://jacintakongresearch.wordpress.com) for information about my research.
