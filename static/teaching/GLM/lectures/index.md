## Using datasets

Datasets used here are from the package `MASS` which comes with R. To use any data in `MASS`, `library(MASS)` needs to be loaded first.

There are some example code that you should also ty out yourself. I recommend creating an R script or Rmarkdown document for your own notes.

## Revision questions

There are some questions for you to answer throughout the chapters. Click `code` to see the answers to the questions. Some questions don't have answers but you should think about them.
